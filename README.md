# d3smartshop

A mobile app developed in React-Native for shopping which pulls/compares price data based on one or more parameters:

Location(distance), Price Range, Specific set of stores, coupons available

And finds the lowest price based a user-defined shopping list of groceries.

I.e. if a user defines a shopping list as:

1.Cheese 
2.Bread 
3.Crackers 

Multiple lists will be generated from different stores, in the order from the smallest ### Total ### price
